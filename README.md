## Project Luther
OLS linear regression analysis project -- Metis DS Bootcamp

## Worklist
Here is my checklist of things to do:
* Scraped batting statistics and salary information from all players on 40-man roster of each baseball team
* Clean baseball reference data (no pitchers, no rookie contracts, no players below mendoza line, remove outliers)
* Perform a boxcox transformation on salaries for model
* Pare down best features using kfold Cross Validation and reference learning curves
* Try polynomial regression and other more advanced modeling techniques to check performance improvement
* Retrain my model using the ultimate OLS linear regression chosen and run on test set to get final R^2 and RMSE

## Priorities

1. Scrape baseball-reference
2. Clean data
3. EDA
4. Find features
5. Cross validate models and run learning curves
6. Retrain model and run on final test set
7. Push final project repo to "student_submissions/projects/project_luther" under a new branch off the master -- create a directory there, and add the files
