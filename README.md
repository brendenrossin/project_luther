| Person | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Brent | Stuff |

## Priorities

1. MTA Data
2. Yelp
3. Crime
4. Overlay data on map for presentation?
5. Create powerpoint and go over presentation logistics (~1-1.5 min per group member) 
6. Push final project repo to "student_submissions/projects/project_benson" under a new branch off the master -- create a directory there, and add the files
